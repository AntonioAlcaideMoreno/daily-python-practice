        # language: python

        # Key change: Use language: system instead of language: python
          #  Why language: system fixes it:
          #  language: python creates an isolated virtual environment with only the specified additional_dependencies
          #  language: system uses the currently active Python environment (your activated venv with numpy and pandas already installed)

        # additional_dependencies:
        # - pytest>=7.0.0
        # - pytest-cov>=4.0.0  # if you need coverage
        # # types: [python]
